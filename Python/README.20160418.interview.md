- Use _decorator_ in Python

  - England: ['dekəreɪtə]
  - USA: ['dɛkəretɚ]

  - Why I put the phonetic symbols here is because in the interview I heard something like **[dikriː'eɪtə]**...

  - The answer is super easy and obvious, but unfornately I didn't identify that he was saying **_decorator_** at that time.....

  - English listening abilities and self-confidence in stressed condition still need to be improved.
