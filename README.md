## Description
- This repository is for recording the algorithm source code which are made in daily algorithm practice.
- The source code is organized by programming language, problem source and maybe also the contests.
- You can find the corresponding compiler info inside each individual source file.

## Accumulations / References
1. Find out the length of the longest path and one possible longest path in a multi-way tree
  - Required tree description example: {5: {0: [6, 7], 1: [9, 0], 2: [4], 5: [1], 6: [3, 8], 7: [2]}}
    - '5' is root
    - '{0: [6, 7], 1: [9, 0], 2: [4], 5: [1], 6: [3, 8], 7: [2]}' is paths descriptions
  - Source code and explanation refer to: [high_speed_camera_cover.py -> find_longest_road(tree, root)](algorithm/codility.com/20160330/high_speed_camera_cover/high_speed_camera_cover.py)
