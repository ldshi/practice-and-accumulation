- Implicit data type conversion in JavaScript when comparing integer with string using ==
  ```
  console.log('1' == 1)  ->  true
  console.log('2' == 2)  ->  true
  console.log('' == 0)   ->  true
  console.log(1 == {toString: null})  ->  TypeError!
  ```

- What is the difference between "==" and "==="
  - The only difference between them is that == will do type coercion to try to get the values to match, and === won't. So for instance "1" == 1 is true, because "1" coerces to 1. But "1" === 1 is false, because the types don't match. ("1" !== 1 is true.) The first (real) step of === is "Are the types of the operands the same?" and if the answer is "no", the result is false. If the types are the same, it does exactly what == does.
  - For type coercion, refer to:
