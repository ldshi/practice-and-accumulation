    - Question
      - Provide data about all books having been written by Andrew Duncan only, i.e. without any other co-authors.
    - Solution
    
      ```
      select
        a.id as ID_of_Book,
        a.title as Title,
        a.isbn as Isbn,
        a.publication_year as Publication_Year,
        a.publisher_id as Publisher_id,
        b.book_id as Book_id,
        b.author_id as Author_id,
        c.id as ID_of_Author,
        c.first_name as First_name,
        c.last_name as Last_name
      from Book as a
        join Writing as b on a.id = b.book_id
        join Author as c on b.author_id = c.id
      group by a.id
      having count(*) = 1 and c.first_name = 'Andrew' and c.last_name = 'Duncan'
      ```
    - Explanation and critical points
      - First 'joins' have to be done among tables: Book, Writing and Author, here you should imagine you will get a middle records like the below image shows:
        - <img src="images/20160401_1.png"/>
      - Then meet the 'group by' and 'having' statements:
        - The 'group by' statement will proceed the 'group operation' by the condition given by you after the 'by' and form the records into several groups(like the coloured boxs in above pic), then proceed the 'having conditions' on each group: apparently, only will possibly omit some reconrds from some groups.
      - Here is: will omit those record(book) which 'has more than one author(**count(*) = 1**)' or 'the author is not Andrew Duncan'.
      - Finally will extract the first record out from each group and form into the final record.

      - So:
        - 'having statement' to 'group by statement' just like 'where statement' to 'select statement', the execution process is inseparable.
        - If 'group by' doesn't have 'having', then will always extract the first record out from each group and form into the new records.

      - When proceed the join operation, if two tables have the same column, then some SQL product will use the later one override the previous one.
      - So:
        - Never use '*' in the 'select', this is a good practice.
        - If two tables have same columns, then rename them use 'as' in 'select' will get around of this problem.
